The Discovery of Handwashing\n","<p>In the mid 1800s, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was an obstetrician at Vienna General Hospital. At the time, maternal death due to puerperal fever was common, but he was particularly concerned that the death rate in his clinic (Clinic 1) was much higher than the death rate in another clinic at Vienna General Hospital (Clinic 2). <em>So what was the difference between these two clinics?</em> Doctors and midwives worked in Clinic 1, while only midwives worked in Clinic 2. This led Dr. Semmelweis to hypothesize that doctors carried deadly \"cadaverous particles\" from their autopsies to their patients in Clinic 2.</p>\n","<p>In 1847, Dr. Semmelweis instated a policy where doctors had to use a chlorine solution to wash their hands between performing autopsies and seeing patients. The maternal mortality rate drastically decreased as seen in the plot below. Sadly, germ theory (the idea that there are particles that cause disease) was not widely accepted at the time, so his hypothesis was rejected by most doctors.</p>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1187/img/semmelweis_plot.png\" alt=\"Line plot of maternal mortality rate in Clinic 1 at Vienna General Hospital\" width=\"600px\"></p>\n","<p>The two datasets you will use are from Dr. Semmelweis's original 1859 publication<sup>1</sup>.
